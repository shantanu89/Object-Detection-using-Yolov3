# Object-Detection-using-Yolov3-Darknet

Object detection code using pretraing model Yolov3

Steps:

1) Clone the yolov3  darknet model and unzip it into your desired location
2)link for yolo model----->https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet
3) setup this into your system
4) clone my jupyter notebook files
5) set the proper path to yolo darknet model with yolo darknet files
6) for performing object detection on image use pedestriandetection.ipnyb file
7) for performing object detection on video stream use pedestrian_and_vehical_detection_using_video_Stream.ipnyb file
8) run the code you can see the output
